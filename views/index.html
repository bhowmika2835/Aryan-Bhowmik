      <marquee>There are many endangered species out there and we think that this
          initiative will allow the animal population to sustain itself. Our
          goal is for zoos to be able to use this network to find mates for 
          their animals so that they can further their development. You can
          think of this as somewhat of an animal tinder and it is up to the 
          zoos to pick out the right mate. This software could be a game-changer 
          and we think that it could really bloom all across the world in the future.</marquee>
